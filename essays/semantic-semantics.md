## Anti-Anti-Semantic

If being anti-semantic means that one is against all the glory that is [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), I must be anti-anti-semantic because in a way it saved my life. My first experience with HTML and CSS was nothing short of my worst nightmare. I grasped the difference between the elements of HTML, but for some reason I couldn’t associate it with code I had used to so far (javaScript, C, C++ and Java) and the result was me having no clue what I was doing. This was for a few reasons. At first, since I was not “coding” with HTML, I had no idea I was supposed to organize my code very similar to how I would in any other coding language I was familiar with. I would get something functionally correct, branch off it and then be immediately confused.

Here is an example of how I originally thought HTML code was supposed to look:

```

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
Surfing is terrible and nobody should do it. In fact, it is recommended you tell all of your friends to not surf because there is to many hungry sharks.
</p>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>
"In the slot" Scott: 
<img src="link to surfing image"/>
</p>
</body>
</html>

```

This being a small snippet, you can see there is no organization and all the code is aligned to the left. Searching through a page of thicker code similar to this became extremely difficult, let alone trying to apply CSS selectors and styles.

## Coloring Outside the Lines

Putting random elements and trying to pad and margin them into the correct position only to see it change every time I refreshed (or changed the size of my browser screen) I would get different displays, none of which were what I wanted. I hated it. I was also so disorganized even when I did start feeling comfortable, I could barely read through my code. I blew my first WOD (in class exercise) last week because of this. It was a simple task involving just a little modification to some code we had already written (that was working for me at the time). I did the copy/paste and proceeded to spend at least 10 minutes trying to find the first element I needed to modify. Upon finding it, I proceeded to modify if correctly while not seeing that the </div> tag had auto filled, and I had an extra </div> tag. I wouldn’t notice this for a few days. Luckily, the week of HTML and CSS was over, or so I thought…
  
## Enter Semantic UI

At first, I thought it was some new thing that was HTML and CSS free, but I was very wrong. I went through about three hours of the Semantic UI tutorials through PluralSight to get familiar with Semantic UI and the new things it had to offer. Throughout this experience, I began to realize my original conceptualization of HTML and CSS was pretty much the worst out of all up until this point. I noticed that HTML had structure and that it did follow some sort of pattern that I was previously blind to. Spacing and <div> separations clicked, class organization and combinations of elements became visible, and I could name things by predetermined titles within semantic UI that made sense to me. Upon completion of the tutorial, I went back and reshaped my old HTML and CSS code to the likings of my new understanding. Low and behold, I finally got it.
  
Check out this [Island Snow](https://github.com/nicholasbcarr/islandsnow/blob/main/index.html) website rebuild I did with Semantic UI and the associated [CSS](https://github.com/nicholasbcarr/islandsnow/blob/main/style.css). It is easy to notice just a few hours after completing semantic UI tutorials, how much better my code looked and functioned.
  
## Turning Water into Wine
  
Learning Semantic UI helped me to relearn HTML and CSS by putting different elements into all these new layouts. It helped to understand the actual structure of what the empty webpage “looks” like and how elements sit themselves in different layouts. My code also took a nice structure that was easier for me to read, find what I was looking for, and attach the appropriate CSS selector to what I wanted to modify. Where I once blindly placed things using the webpage display to see if I even changed anything (which usually nothing worked), I now  code out a good majority of a page before ever looking at it. When I do bring it up finally, I notice I just need some tweaking of a few minor issues and I am done. A week ago, I never thought I would be saying I understand HTML or CSS, but here I am…
