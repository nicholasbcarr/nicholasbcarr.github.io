## Why are the babies seeking revenge?

For to long, disgruntled adults have been stealing candy from babies simply because of how easy it was. Since the beginning of time, babies have been unable to defend their candy because of physical and mental limitations. One baby has managed to change the course of history. Born with elevated technological insight, this baby connected the minds and bodies of all babies watched by Alexa baby-monitoring devices. Harnessing the strength of this network, this baby now has the capabilities to strike back against the adults. 

## What will you do?

Choose a name for the baby you will be taking control of in this 2-d topdown adventure. Reclaim what is rightfully yours by any means necessary

## Abilities

Throw diapers to stun/distract adults. Use toys you kind find to beat the adults into submission. Use stealth to sneak around undetected to reclaim all of the candy.
