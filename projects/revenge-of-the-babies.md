# Revenge of The Babies

Check out our [website](https://sendit-studios.github.io/)
 where you can play the game and view the trailer for the game! The experience of making a game from just a funny thought all the way through a complete multi-level version was as much fun as it was educational. Deveoping the AI algorithm forced me to pull knowledge from one of the hardest classes of my degree path but I enjoyed seeing how algorithms work in a gaming environment. This experience left me wanting to create more games and take my skills in the field even further.
